<h2>
Where Im from?
</h2>
<p>
My name Jalen Hollywood, the age of 19 of <i>Caruthersville</i>, <i>Missouri</i> It is located at the bottom of the state of Missouri , which many call it the bootheel. Caruthersville lies in Missouri's Bootheel on the Mississippi River. The word <strong>"Pemiscot"</strong> comes from the word pemiskaw, meaning "liquid mud" in the Fox language. It lies border line from Arkansas and Tennessee. It could be 15 to 30 minutes away! Growing Up here, I can say that we are very country but the best of small town living around. I don't think it's any town as popular and historical as ours around the pemiscot county.

<h3>
Growing Up and School?
</h3>
<p>
Growing up I had alot of friends around and majority of the city is my family, which you know how small my town is. We didn't have many food spots growing up but, we had a Walmart and a couple of grocery stores that we could go to and get our needs. Time flew by then, they got rid of the most important store in town, which was Walmart. They got rid of that, I felt like the whole town started falling apart more and more because that made us drive 15 to 30 minutes to Arkansas or Tennessee just to go grocery shopping. It was a huge impact of the city. The schools in Caruthersville is a major public school. Nothing around is public unless you're in another town. I graduated with about 50 to 60 students. Yes, my town was a low population and still is which is about 6,000 citizens there. Growing up in that school, from headstart to 12th grade I learned alot but it was many moments I had to teach myself what I was learning. I plan on making my city mines whenever I get rich soon!

Highschool Sports?
</h1>
<p>
Growing up I loved the game of basketball. I played rec league basketball to I couldn't play for them no more. I disliked <strong>football</strong> so that's why I never played in peewee but once. I didn't like it so i pursued the dream of basketball and thought I was going to be the man of basketball coming in 6th grand. I was known as a great shooter in basketball but, I went to tryouts and didn't make the team that year so I moved to football. Played football from 7th to my 12th grade year. I loved it when I made it to highschool. I was the man that played varsity from my freshman year all the way up. I was a stud player on the field , my positions were middle linebacker. I was a hard hitter on the field. I recieved the following rewards my senior ending year coming off an ACL injury:

Goals and Future?
</h1>
<p>
We all have dreams that we are chasing day by day hping we achieve them. Some will achieve them an some will not which is crazy. I feel like the secret to achieving what you want to achieve is to not be lazy. If you are not lazy and you want something, you are going to go get it. Don't nothing comes to a sleeper but a dream. So, get up and make something happen. I have major dreams that <i>I AM</i> going to achieve sooner than soon. I have in mind that I am goign to graduate college of engineering but, be <strong>rich</strong> before I graduate from being a youtuber! Me and my brother page will blow up soon and we will be where we want to be sooner than soon which I believe. We all know what we want but, are we going to achieve It ?

Everyday Hobbies/Freetime?
</h1>
<u1>
<li>Go To Class</li>
<li>Go Workout</li>
<li>Play The Game</li>
<li>Do My Work</li>
<li>Chill With Friends</li>
<p>
The life of being a <strong>college student</strong> isn't hard as it seems. You just have to stay on your things and stay tuned in for whats the next obstacle. For 1, you cannot be lazy and be in college. You will be put behind on work or it just wouldn't work out with you well. I also love to go workout on my free time or I'll make time for it like I want to do it. I go harder and harder every day that I do something. It doesnt matter if im doing anything, I know I will give it 100% to make sure what evers in my way will be beat and broken down. And that's just my mentality for everything in life, which is <i>"Dominate"</i>.

A Journey I Conquered!
</h2>
<p>
I've been through some things but I would like to share one of my major journeys with you guys on when I tore my ACL. Up there before on the other page noticed I told you all I tore my ACL before. I tore it my junior year and it was only the 3rd game. I was running for the tackle and my leg was planted into the grass stuck and my knee bent some kind of way to the right. It popped 4 times and I fell and yelled like my leg was broken. I went through all of that and had to have surgery later the other month of November. I went through surgery and it was the worst feeling ever. But, after all I came back for my senior year and dominated better than all the years I played. I played with revengence and a mentality to dominate and be better than anyone that stepped across from me. The picture below will show the game I tore my ACL in:

I was born on April 22, 2003 so I am the age of 19 now and now in college. I am a IT Engineering major of The University Of Missouri and is pursing my dreams to be the best that came through. I want to be rich before I graduate but that is going to come from being a youtuber with my brother. We will reach the top soon and you that reading this <strong>right now</strong> heard it here first. I have dreams and visuals of doing it so we are going to do it and we're going to do it right. One video will blow up and we will take off on everyone. It will be <i>sooner than sooner</i> and I want you as the reader to know that. A couple quotes I will like to share with you guys describes my mentality,<strong>“Greatness is sifted through the grind, therefore don't despise the hard work now for surely it will be worth it in the end.”</strong>
